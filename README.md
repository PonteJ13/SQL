# SQL

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio. This repository contains SQL examples I have written while learning and obtaining my certifications through the course Break Into Tech designed by Charlotte Chaze. All obtained certifications can also be found and verified on my LinkedIn profile.

Feel free to look and also ask any questions you may have.

In addition to my learning I used to perform basic queries in a professional setting in my prior roles as a Low-Code Solutions Specialist utilizing Hyland OnBase. I would create ad-hoc UI buttons for end users to utlize in OnBase Unity Client on a day-to-day basis to query documents from internal storage.
